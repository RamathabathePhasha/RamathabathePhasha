I'm a determined young woman who loves IT and is currently in my third year of studying IT software development. 
Even though I haven't worked yet, I've done a lot of projects and assignments that show I'm good at what I do. 
I've got National Certificates in IT System Development from Jeppe College, which I earned in 2020 and 2021. 
These certificates prove that I'm serious about learning and have the skills needed for IT jobs.
Right now, I'm working on getting a Diploma in Software Development at Belgium Campus ITversity. 
I've finished all the modules for my first and second years, which has made me even better at software development.
